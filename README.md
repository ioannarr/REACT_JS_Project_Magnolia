## Observations

The code as is solves item display, adding items to the cart, bringing items alltogether and sets itemorder information from and to firestore. The order is done in shape of a form capturing manually the customers information. It does not  yet still allow a real checkout with payment information, however it provides complete cart logic.

** On this challenge I was able to learn about ** : 

- Functional components and React Hooks, specially use Effect and use State.
- The use of an API context within React,
- JSX languange and,
- Separating the logic from the rendering and the techniques used to render conditionnaly.

** The ecommerce site was a challenge for me, for its one of the largest projects Ive so worked on so far, and specially the firebase tool for it has its own jargon **
